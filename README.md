## Your Web Application Title

This app is a simple to-do list that has been heavily stylized with CSS and flexbox. It utilizes DOM in the JS file to manipulate HTML attributes and communicate with the server.
It users to add tasks with a priority level, view the tasks in a grid format with derived fields like creation date and deadline (exactly a week later).
There are two buttons, one to add a task and another to clear all the tasks.

## Technical Achievements

- My website is a single-page with a form submission feature that submits and displays the server data. It also shows derived fields of each submission for the user.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- I did the think-aloud protocol with Cody Rueda. We met in person to go over our code. Here are the results:

Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.

- Cody Rueda

What problems did the user have with your design?

- The user did not have many problems with my design. The only thing I noticed was that in clearing the tasks, Cody had assumed that it only deleted one task, not all of them.

What comments did they make that surprised you?

- Cody spoke about the CSS of my design, said it was very dark which I understand. He said he enjoyed the grid format which I was excited about because I had to do some research to figure that out.

What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?

- I would make the background color a bit lighter and contrast the color of the square submissions against it more to make it more readable. I would also try to implement a button that deletes just one task.
